// There are two types of linked lists.
// Singly linked lists and doubly linked lists
// A singly linked list contain nodes with two elements.
// The value of the data stored in the node and a pointer to the next node.
// The first node is called the head, the last node is called the tail.
// Linked lists are null terminated. A linked list ends when the tail node points to null.

// Linked list can be sorted or unsorted.
// Javascript dosen't come with linked lists, unlike Java etc

// Linked lists have a loose structure
// Array and linked lists differ because elements have an index.
// Iterating through a linked list is usually slower than an array
// Linked lists have an order. Each node points to the next node.

// Ponters:
// A ponter is a reference to another place in memory.
const obj1 = {a: test};
const obj2 = obj1

// Obj2 referring to obj1 is a pointer. It's just referring to an address in memory.
// Both obj1 and obj2 point to the same point in memeory.

// A ponter says this is where x is in memory
