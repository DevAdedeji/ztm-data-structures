// Traversals
// Traversals means going from node to node and making sure that the node being searched for is found

// Traversal and search are often used interchangeably.
// Sometinmes though, we want to perform a particular operation on each node.

// Or the tree isn't sorted or it's an unordered graph
// Traversal is visiting every node... that's an O(n) operation.

// Breadth fisrt search/traversal
// Depth first search/traversal

// The main benefit of why we dont put complex data into jsut lists that are sorted is that we get the O(log n) searching.

// Trees and graphs work well for lots of cases. And there's better performance for something like an array.

// DFS vs BFS
