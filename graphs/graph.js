// A graph is a set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion

// Graphs are widely used when it comes to modelling real life.
// Looks like a network with connections to different nodes/vertex

// Nodes are connected with edges
// Graphs are great model structures for modelling the real world

// Graphs are useful for things that connect to other things. Like the internet. Graphs can be used to represent human connections(friendships etc), roads etc

// Graphs encompass other data structures.
// Linked lists for example are a type of tree.
// Trees in return are a type of graph.

// Types of graphs
// Directed and undirected graphs
// Traffic flow or system where movement is not bi directional

// Weighted and unweigheted graph
// Values can be applied to various aspects of a graph, not just the nodes.
// The edges connecting the nodes in graphs also carry information
// Google maps for example can use a weighted graph to calculate the shortest distance between two destinations.


// A weighted graph in short is the type of graph where the edges carry sone information

// Cyclic and acyclic graphs
// When vertcices/edges are connected in cycle, there's a cyclic graph.

// Acyclic dosen't allow that.
// Cyclic graphs are especially common in weighted graphs, such as google maps.
