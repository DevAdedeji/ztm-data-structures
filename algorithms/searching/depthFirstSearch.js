// Depth first search follows the tree down as many nodes as possible, until the target node is found or the enbd is reached.

// When the search can't go further, it continues at the nearest ancestor with an unexplored child.

// Depth first search has a lower memory required because it's not necessary to store the child pointers on each level.

// We go depth first with depth first search.
