// Bellman OR Dijkstra algorithms for figuring out shortest path

// BFS assumes that each path has the same weight
// Shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

// Bellman Ford's algorithm is more effective at solving the shortest path over Djikstra's algorithm because it can accommodate negative weights.

// Belllman ford takes longer to run in terms of time complexity... O(n^2)
