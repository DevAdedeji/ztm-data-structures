// Traversals
// Traversals means going from node to node and making sure that the node being searched for is found

// Traversal and search are often used interchangeably.
// Sometinmes though, we want to perform a particular operation on each node.

// Or the tree isn't sorted or it's an unordered graph
// Traversal is visiting every node... that's an O(n) operation.

// Breadth fisrt search/traversal
// Depth first search/traversal

// The main benefit of why we dont put complex data into jsut lists that are sorted is that we get the O(log n) searching.

// Trees and graphs work well for lots of cases. And there's better performance for something like an array.

// DFS vs BFS
// Both DFS and BFS do the same thing, technically. When should one be chosen over the other.

// The time complexity for DFS and BFS is the same. They all visit the nodes at least once.
// Breadth first search. Pros 
// Shortest Path.
// Closer nodes.

// Cons.
// Consumes More Memory.

// We always start off with the root node and search the closest nodes.
// If there's additional information. Then breadth first search.

// Depth First Search. Pros
// Depth first search consumes less memory.
// Graet for finding out if path exists

// Cons
// Can get slow
