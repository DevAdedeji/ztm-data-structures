// Recursion really isn't an algorithm. It's more of a concept.
// Recursion is when something is defined within itself.
// A recursive function, for example is a function that calls itself.

const recursive = () => {
	recursive()
}

// recursive as the name suggests is a recursive function because it's going to call itself.
// Recursion is useful for tasks with repeated tasks to do.
// Recursion is important because it's used in searching and sorting algorithms.
