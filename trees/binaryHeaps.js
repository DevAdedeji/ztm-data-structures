// Binary heaps have every child belonging to a parent node that has a higher prority

// A max heap has the root node value as the highest value
// A min heap has the root node value as the lowest value
// The node value can be any data type

// heap lookup O(n)
// heap insert O(log n)
// heap delete O(log n)

// Are more favorable in algorithms that prioritize sorting.
// Why use a binary heap?
// Binary heaps are great for comparative operations
// Heaps are used a lot in data storage, priority queues, sorting algorithms. 
// Heaps have values from left to right.
// The highest value bubbles up the node tree.

// P.S: Memory heaps != heap data structure.
// Heap in terms of memory is a region where arbitrary data can be stored in memory. Naming is coincidatal. Heap in terms of memory is a 'heap of memory'


// To understand how binary heaps work, we have to talk about priority queues.
// Heaps take the lowest amount of space posssible due to left to right insertion
// There's no concept of an unbalanced heap. They preserve the order of insertion.

// Priority queues is a type of data where each data has a priority and elements with higher pririty are served before elements with lower priority.

// Binary heap pros: Better than O(n)
// allows setting priorities
// Flexible size
// Fast insert

// Cons
// Slow lookup
