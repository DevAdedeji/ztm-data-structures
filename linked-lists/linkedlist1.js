// There are two types of linked lists.
// Singly linked lists and doubly linked lists
// A singly linked list contain nodes with two elements.
// The value of the data stored in the node and a pointer to the next node.
// The first node is called the head, the last node is called the tail.
// Linked lists are null terminated. A linked list ends when the tail node points to null.

// Linked list can be sorted or unsorted.
// Javascript dosen't come with linked lists, unlike Java etc
