// A trie is a specialized tree used in searching. Most often with text.

// It can outperform most data structures in some cases.

// A trie allows you to know if a word or a part of a word exists in a body of text.
// Tries have an empty root node.
// Letters are added from there.

// Tries are also called pre fix trees.
// It can solve string specific trees.

// Autocomplete, diuctionaries, word lookups etc

// Big O(length of word)
// Benefits inclued speed and space.

// Space complexity is also efficient
// They use prefixes in different words, it dosen't have to be stored in multiple places.
